Exploratory Data Analysis in USA College Basketball (2015-2019) dataset. From a young age my passion is playing and watching basketball. The motivation is to learn the history of college basketball and what is the formula for success within a team.

Being a fan of movies myself, I wanted to learn more about the Golden Globe awards and trends. Here I focus on feature engineering to be able to gather more meaningful insight of the different types of awards and succesful movies, directors and actors/actresses.
