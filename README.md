- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation
	- [California Housing Dataset:](https://github.com/Richieone13/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/California_Housing_Dataset/California_Housing_Exploration.ipynb) This is a dataset from O'Reilly textbook (Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow), on the Califorina Housing Market. I learnt different libraries using Python, i.e. importing, understanding and visualising the data. There are 20640 instances and 10 attributes in the dataset. The motivation of this exercise is to allow to explore different methodologies of making use of the dataset and finding interesting insight.

	- [Loan Prediction WIP:](https://github.com/Richieone13/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/LoanPrediction/Loan%20Prediction%20for%20Mortgage.ipynb)
	It has application in retail banking/finance, I believe it is a legal requirement in some countries to explain to the applicant why the loan was declined, and you can drill down and based on xyz, your loan is declined. This is a project I'm working on indepently 

Maybe able to use this data there depending on what the criteria is to explain why the application was declinded.
